The list must include items such as buckles, straps, soles, logos, size markings, and any structural details. If any element is missing from the existing description, append it to the description immediately, ensuring no overlap with Texture or Pattern rules."

If a tactile descriptor is not visually evident, leave the material noun unchanged. Ensure that each material mention is accompanied by a texture adjective, and no generic terms remain."

Replace any generic phrase with a precise, vivid description such as 'printed floral pattern with embroidered roses in emerald green' or 'black-and-white pinstripe with diagonal offset'. Ensure the resulting phrase fully reflects the pattern\u2019s visual characteristics."
